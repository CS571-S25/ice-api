  "Why are trees so carefree and happy in spring? Because they finally leaf their worries behind!",
  "Why is everyone so tired on April 1st? They just finished a 31-day March.",
  "Why did the gardener plant a seed in his computer? He wanted to download spring!",
  "What's spring's favorite kind of pickles? Daffo-dills!",
  "What did the big flower say to the little flower? Hi, bud!",
  "What do you call a snowman in April? A puddle.",
  "Why do birds fly south in the Spring? It's quicker than walking!",
  "How excited was the garden about spring? So excited it wet its plants!"
